# Opossuminute
### An opossum themed pomodoro timer for the chaotic gremilin inside of us all.

This is a Open Source project created for fun and experimentation. 
But why, though?
Searching briefly on the internet for pomodoro timers it can be observed that most of them are serious, administrative and business oriented. There's a lack of endorphins enducing creative animal based timers.
The main idea is to create a platform that is:

 - Accessible
 - Neurodivergent/Neuroatipical friendly
 - Simple
 - Light
 - Minimalist
 - Fun
 - Criative
 - with Opossum doodles

Feel free to ask of anything and to contribute on the project!
